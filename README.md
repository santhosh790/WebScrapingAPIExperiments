# WebScrapingAPIExperiments
This repo is for evaluating various webscraping tools and understand the better tool for different use cases

So far, Python based Webscraping packages such as 
1. Mechanize
2. MechanicalSoup
3. Scrapy 
are evaluated. 


I'll keep adding the scraping tools as and when I evaluate.

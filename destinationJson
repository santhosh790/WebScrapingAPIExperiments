To avoid this scenario and ensure a smooth user experience, we calculated that the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) requires up to 56,000 IOPS,” said Matthew Rounthwaite, ICT security and risk manager at ACC.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the New Zealand government’s “cloud-first” approach stipulates strict data governance and privacy requirements. To address these requirements, the ACC is currently working with a hybrid cloud model to improve visibility and cost control at the critical infrastructure level. Advanced storage and server virtualization will help the organization to port systems more easily to the cloud in future.</p>\r\n<p>“We wanted an end-to-end view of the performance of core applications with the ability to drill down all the way into the database layer.
